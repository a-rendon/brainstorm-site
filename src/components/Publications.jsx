            <p>
  As the userâ€™s focus increases, the game gradually slows down and stabilizes 
  in speed, creating a calmer, more controlled experience. Conversely, when 
  focus decreases, the game accelerates, introducing more difficulty to encourage
  re-engagement and help users regain control. The penalty for losing, a mandatory 
  five-second delay before restarting, reinforces the incentive to stay focused by 
  making in-game time more valuable and emphasizing the importance of sustained attention.
