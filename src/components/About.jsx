By combining neurofeedback with immersive VR games, we empower individuals, especially those with ADHD, to train focus, calm, and mental clarity in ways that feel intuitive and fun. We believe mental health support should be proactive, affordable, and integrated into everyday life, not just reserved for clinical settings.</p>
